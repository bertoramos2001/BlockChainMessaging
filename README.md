# Message HardHat SmartContracts Project

This is my first project working with Smart Contracts and BlockChain. I built it following this [buildspace tutorial](https://buildspace.so/p/build-solidity-web3-app) made by [Farza](https://twitter.com/FarzaTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).

It basically consists on a simple web, where, after logging in with a crypto wallet,you can send messages which will be stored on the blockchain, and each sender has a chance to receive rewards. Once you enter the web, you will have to log in and then you will be able to send messages and see all the previous messages sent on the blockchain.

I wanted to make it a bit more personal so I added footballs to every message.

You can see the whole working project [here](https://waveportal-starter-project.bertoramos2001.repl.co/).
